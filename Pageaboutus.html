Just one was modified by the Jaguar factory for owner Peter Lindner, the German Jaguar importer, to low drag body design. He raced it with Peter Nocker<br> <br> When it crashed in at the Montlhery circuit in 1964 the Linder-Nocker Lightweight was so badly damaged that a complete restoration was thought to be impossible. CMC thought differently and decided to bring it back to its former glory. This epic project was finished in 2011, after over 7,000 hours of work and using more than 90% of the original parts, and won CMC the ‘Restoration of the Year’ at the International Historic Motoring Awards that year.<p>
